> [!bible] Hebrews 9:15-22 
> (15) And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. (16) For where there [is] a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. (17) For a testament [is] in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives. (18) Therefore not even the first [covenant] was dedicated without blood. (19) For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, (20) saying, "This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you." (21) Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. (22) And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.

## Intro

Let's start this message at the end. 

> **Matthew 26:26-28**
> (26) And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body." (27) Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. (28) "For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

There's a reason why we're switching to weekly communion. This meal is at the heart of the Gospel. And there is perhaps no greater meditation on it than our passage in Hebrews today. 

* Story of me talking to Muslim man in the airplane on the way to Istanbul.  He could not comprehend a paradigm in which the great Jesus would die.
	* Why could God not just forgive us?
	* Why could God not just create a covenant with us?  Why is a death needed? 
	* Why was it necessary for Christ to die? 

1. **Main Point:** Christ is the mediator of the new covenant... by means of death
2. **Supporting Claim:** Covenants are only valid with blood
3. **Supporting Example:** The first covenant was inaugurated with blood
4. **Why:** Shedding of blood is necessary for cleansing and forgiveness 

## 1. Main Point: Christ is the mediator of the new covenant... by means of death

> [!bible] Hebrews 9:15
>  And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, **by means of death,** for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

### The new covenant

Jesus Christ is the mediator of this new covenant, the great high priest. This is what we have been dwelling on for the past couple of chapters. 

Remember: We **need** a mediator. We **need** a go-between to represent us to God and intercede for us. We can't come into God's holy, holy, holy presence by ourselves. God is described as an all-consuming fire. It will destroy all impurity.  And if we are impure.... We would be destroyed as well. 

> [!note] 
> A covenant is an agreement 2 or more people. Specifically in this context, the author is talking about God-initiated agreements God and man - How he relates to us, and how we relate to Him. How we can approach him and be saved from just wrath. 

The new covenant is:
#### 1. For the redemption of transgressions

This is not just a "covering" of sins. This is full cleansing from the inside out. This is something that the old covenant could not accomplish.

> **Hebrews 9:11-14**
> (11) But Christ came [as] High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. (12) Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. (13) For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, ==(14) how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?==

#### 2. Eternal in nature

"Promise of eternal inheritance".

Try to think about eternity for a minute. A year goes by. Then another. Then another. Then a decade, then another. A lifetime. A century, then two. A thousand years, and then another, and another. A million years, and still the calendar runs on for countless ages and millennia.  Every day explodes with with the love and delight of an infinite God in which there are more worlds to be explored, and glory to be discovered, and adventures to be had, and more of God to worship and be satisfied by. 

This is what it means to be part of the new covenant. Salvation now, and eternal inheritance in the future. 

#### 3. Is accomplished by means of death

Some translations say:
* by means of death
* since a death has occurred
* a death having taken place
* now that he has died
* he has died

How did Jesus accomplish the new covenant? How did he seal the deal? **by means of death**. The death of the Mediator, Christ, was **necessary** in order to initiate this amazing new covenant. 

But why? Glad you asked.

## 2. **Supporting Claim:** Covenants are only valid with death

* We'll replace "testament" with "will" and "testator" with "will-maker", as they mean the same thing.

> [!bible] Hebrews 9:16-17 NKJV 
> (16) For where there [is] a [will], there must also of necessity be the death of the [will-maker]. (17) For a [will] [is] in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the [will-maker] lives.

* Some debate on how these verses should be translated. The issue is how we are supposed to translate "diathēkē".  It can mean either "covenant" or "will/testament". 
	* Majority view
		* Diathēkē should be translated as "will" or "testament" these verses.
		* Paraphrase: Here's an analogy to help you understand. A death is required in the new covenant to make it of any effect, just like the death of the will-maker is required to make a will of any effect. 
		* In this reading, Jesus is the will-maker who is dying.
		* Supported by most Bible translations; Connected to the "inheritance" idea of verse 15. 
	* Minority view
		* Diathēkē should be translated as "covenant" in these verses.
		* Paraphrase: In every covenant, a death must be undertaken. For a covenant like this takes effect only upon dead bodies - it has no power otherwise. 
		* In this reading, sinful humans are the ones who need to die or obtain a sacrifice to the covenant in order to make it valid. 
		* Supported by the fact that the literal translation of "after men are dead" is "over dead corpses", and that every other mention of diathēkē in Hebrews is clearly meant to refer to "covenant". 

Each view brings out different angles and nuances... But the overarching point remains. **Covenants are only valid with death.**

> [!note]
> There's different kinds of covenants in the Bible. The author of Hebrews is talking about a special kind of covenant - one that relates to forgiveness of sins and relationship between God and man.

## 3. **Supporting Example:** The first covenant was inaugurated with blood

> [!bible] Hebrews 9:18-21
> (18) Therefore not even the first [covenant] was dedicated without blood. (19) For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, (20) saying, "This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you." (21) Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.


* Exodus 24:1-8
	* After chapters of law (ten commandments is chapter 10), the covenant is sealed with blood.
	* Location: Sinai.

> **Exodus 24:1-8**
> (1) Now He said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar. (2) "And Moses alone shall come near the LORD, but they shall not come near; nor shall the people go up with him." (3) So Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, "All the words which the LORD has said we will do." (4) And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD. And he rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel. (5) Then he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD. (6) And Moses took half the blood and put [it] in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar. (7) Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, "All that the LORD has said we will do, and be obedient." (8) And Moses took the blood, sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, =="This is the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made with you according to all these words."==

* Leviticus 8 - consecration of priests and tabernacle. 

> **Leviticus 8:14-15, 18-19, 22-24, 30** 
> (14) And he brought the bull for the sin offering. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering, (15) and Moses killed [it]. Then he took the blood, and put [some] on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement for it. ... (18) Then he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, (19) and Moses killed [it]. Then he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. ... (22) And he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration. Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, (23) and Moses killed [it]. Also he took [some] of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. (24) Then he brought Aaron's sons. And Moses put [some] of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar. ... (30) Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which [was] on the altar, and sprinkled [it] on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.

## 4. **Why:** Shedding of blood is necessary for cleansing and forgiveness 

> [!bible] Hebrews 9:22 
> And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.

* Remember the flow:
	* Christ established the new covenant by **means of death**
	* Supporting claim: Covenants are only valid with death
	* Supporting example: The first covenant was inaugurated with death

Now we get to the "Why". Shedding of blood is necessary for cleansing and forgiveness. 

### An Objection

**Objection:** That seems extreme and unfair. It would be wrong for me to accept blood sacrifices. Why does God? Isn't God more just than that?

**Answer:** On the contrary, anything less exacting and God would be unjust. The blood is mercy.  We must understand two things - the seriousness of sin, and the justice of God.

Where do we get the idea that sin is not a big deal? Sin is when the creature turns against the Creator; when the image bearer blasphemes the One whose image he bears; when the servant rebels against the rightful King of goodness. It is to shake your fist at God and align yourself with the Enemy. It is not a passive thing. It is actively making gods of your desires and lusts, and ultimately setting up yourself as the ultimate false god in your heart. Every lie, every sexual deviancy, every outburst of anger, down to even little things like unloving thoughts comes down to this claim in our hearts: "I will be god". 

This is treason at the highest level imaginable. And the only just thing is for the traitor to pay for his crimes. Throughout history, treason has always been punishable by death. How much more when the offense is not against a kingdom of flesh and blood but the eternal spiritual kingdom? How much more when the offense is against an infinite God? Thus we see justice of God in requiring blood.
### Making it personal

The shedding of blood is needed to cleanse **you** from **your** sin. 

> **1 John 1:7**
> But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, ==and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.==

> **Ephesians 1:7**
>  ==In Him we have redemption through His blood,== the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace

> **1 Peter 1:2** 
> elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience ==and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:== Grace to you and peace be multiplied.

> **1 Peter 18-19**
>  (18) knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, [like] silver or gold, from your aimless conduct [received] by tradition from your fathers, (19) but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.

## Conclusion and Communion

> **Matthew 26:26-28**
> (26) And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body." (27) Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. (28) "For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

Consider Moses, sprinkling the blood of the first covenant on the people. 

Consider your crucified Savior. His death was necessary for us to have peace with God.  It is by means of his death that we can enter into the new covenant, and all the joys and promises that come with it. Even in the imagery of the book of Revelation, Christ is referred to as the "Lamb that was slain" - and so he will be for all eternity.

Consider that we have the opportunity to remember and proclaim the death of Christ every time we gather together and take this meal together.
