# Courage Emmanuel

> [!bible] Deuteronomy 31:1-8
> Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. And he said to them: "I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. Also the LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross over this Jordan.' The LORD your God Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself crosses over before you, just as the LORD has said. And the LORD will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them. The LORD will give them over to you, that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you. Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you." Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it. And the LORD, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed."  

## Intro/Background

* My childrens' names are stones of remembrance
* Title of the sermon - Courage Emmanuel. Almost 2 years to the day when my son Courage was born. 

Here in the final chapters of Deuteronomy, the children of Israel stand on the precipice of a new horizon. For forty long years they have wandered in the wilderness, and now at last they are once again at the gates of the promised land. Just across the Jordan river lies the land promised to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  There was the land flowing with milk and honey, the place of bounty and fruitfulness. Israel sojourned in this land, but his children now stood ready to make it their home.

But there also stood Jericho, that mighty walled city; Hebron, the mountain of giants, and a host of other cities, kingdoms, and hostile armies.  They would not give up the land willingly. They would fight for every square inch. And what's more, they were likely better equipped, more in number, and physically larger and stronger then the Israelites. Forty years earlier, the fearful spies cried out that "We were as grasshoppers in our own sight!" (Num 13:33) And grasshoppers they were still, by the estimation of flesh. They had notched a couple of victories on the east side of Jordan, but victory in the west was by no means assured.

What is even more concerning to the Israelites is that their faithful leader for generation and a half, Moses, is passing away. God had used Moses powerfully in delivering the people from slavery in Egypt, communicating God's law from Mount Sinai, and pleading with God on their behalf.  When Moses held up his hands, victory was assured. Moses knew God. He walked with God, and talked with God - not with visions and dreams, but as a friend speaks with a friend.

Who was going to be the new Moses when Moses was gone? Did Joshua have the right stuff? How in the world was Israel supposed to conquer all these hostile kingdoms? What will happen if the plan fails? 

It is in this backdrop that Moses speaks this text.

> [!bible] Deuteronomy 31:6
> Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you."   

Though we are not Israel or Joshua, and though we are not standing on the banks of Jordan, still this charge applies to New Covenant followers of Christ.  Are we not called to wage a good warfare (1 Tim 1:18)? Are we not told that the weapons of our warfare are mighty? (2 Cor 10:4)? And further, are we not surrounded by enemies on every side that trespass the territory claimed by the Lord Jesus? 

There are enemies within - lusts and passions of the flesh that are contrary to God; there are enemies without - haters of God, false teachers, the World, and the Devil.  Where Joshua and the Israelites faced physical giants, we face even greater challenges - principalities, powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places (Eph 6:12). How much more do we need these words?  May we receive this charge of Moses as the charge of God to every disciple of Jesus Christ. 

### Outline

1. The Commands
2. The Promise

## 1. The Commands

The commands in this text are clear - be strong and of good courage (courageous), and do not fear or be afraid. Technically there are four imperatives - but it's two basic commands.  In typical Hebrew poetic style, each command has two layers.

### Be Strong and of Good Courage

> [!bible] Deuteronomy 31:6a
Be strong and of good courage  

#### A Command

The first thing to observe is that "be strong and of good courage" is a command.  The words in the Hebrew, Kazak and Amats, are active words.  It is not used to describe the mere capacity for strength, like we might say "The man with huge muscles sitting in the park is strong". But rather it is the act of exerting strength _itself_.   Whatever capacity for strength that is available is called upon, marshaled together, and directed towards a single purpose.

"Get ready! Hold tight! Get into position! Exert every fiber of your being! Grip the sword!" 
#### Strength of Mind and Heart

Our second observation is that the the command is not merely to be strong, but also to be courageous. This is strength of mind and heart.

> **Courage:** Bravery; intrepidity; that quality of mind which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness, or without fear or depression of spirits; valor; boldness; resolution.  
> **Webster's 1828 Dictionary**

> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.   
> **Psalms 31:23-24**

#### A Repeated Charge

"Be strong and of good courage" is a charge repeated throughout the scriptures. 

* Moses to Joshua
* God to Joshua
* Joshua to the people of Israel
* David to Solomon
* Paul to the church

This charge is for us. The Apostle Paul uses very similar words in a New Testament context. 

> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.   
> **1 Corinthians 16:13**

> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.   
> **Ephesians 6:10**

This is not to negate the reality of embracing weakness.  The same apostle who wrote "Be strong" also wrote "when I am weak, then I am strong".  Spiritual strength is not about fleshly effort and bravado. 

But it does mean that we posture ourselves with intentionality and manly vigor.  By His grace and power, we face the Enemy with boldness.

### 2. Do Not Fear or Be Afraid

> [!bible] Deuteronomy 31:6b
>  do not fear nor be afraid of them;  

#### 3 Kinds of Fear

1. **Fear of the Lord.** This is the reverence, respect, worship, and fear that we are to have towards God.  This is a healthy fear.
2. **Natural fear.** This is that protective fear that is a part of wisdom. Natural fear keeps us from letting our toddlers wander out into a busy street, and makes us carefully sip coffee to check the temperature before gulping it down. This is also a healthy fear. 
3. **Sinful fear.** This is fear of that which God has told us to NOT be afraid of, and betrays a lack of trust in God. This kind of fear is UNhealthy. 

#### A Harder Command

* A harder command. Be strong and courageous is difficult enough.  But do not fear??? 
* I have realized that I am a fearful person.
    * Fear of messing up as a husband
    * Fear of messing up as a father
    * Fear of upsetting my wife
    * Fear of saying the wrong thing or miscommunication
    * Fear of mismanaging my time
    * Fear of rejection when evangelizing
* I could go on....
    * Fear of losing a job
    * Fear of making the wrong decision
    * Fear of persecution
    * Fear of not having enough money
    * Fear of the future
	* Fear of conflict
    * etc.

Fear drives behavior. And when we allow sinful fear to run rampant, it has ripple effects across our lives and in our relationships. 

In the face of all the enemies before the twelve tribes of Israel, God said "Do not fear". 

#### New Testament 

The command to "fear not" is all over the Bible.  Here are just a couple New Testament references. 

> "And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has power to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, fear Him! "Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. ==Do not fear therefore;== you are of more value than many sparrows.   
> **Luke 12:4-7**

> Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel, ==and not in any way terrified by your adversaries,== which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God.   
> **Philippians 1:27-28**

#### The Problem

How in the world are we supposed to not fear?

## The Promise

### A Problem - "Do Not Fear" Illustration

* Kid vs young teen 
    * Do not fear!
    * How hard is it for him to not fear? Why should he not fear? Wouldn't fear be the rational decision? 
* Kid (plus a couple of large adults) vs young teen
    * The Promise - If he so much as comes towards you, these 3 guys will jump into action and take care of business. 
    * Do not fear!
    * Much easier to obey! 
    * What was the difference?  **The promise makes all the difference.**

### God With Us - Emmanuel

> [!bible]  Deuteronomy 31:6
> Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you."   

A few chapters later in the book of Joshua, God makes the same promise in the first person. 

> Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."   
> **Joshua 1:9**

I don't know if there's a sweeter, more precious promise than this.

Just think of the myriad of promises that God could have made, the multitude of blessings that He could have given.  He could have mere promised success, or that their military training would be effective, or that they would have the best battle strategies.  He could have promised mere Divine power and favor.  He could have promised legions of angels, and sent them from heaven in wave after wave of military strength.

But all these wonderful things fall short of the promise that God gives. He says, "**I** will go with you". 

The Almighty God Himself was about to march into the Promised Land.

What good are giants and Jerichos against the LORD God, maker of heaven and earth? There is no higher authority, there is no higher power. Nothing is too hard for the Lord, and he counts all the nations as but a "drop in a bucket".  

Do. Not. Fear.

### New Testament

This is doubtless what the resurrected Jesus is hearkening back to in the classic passage of Matthew 28. 

> And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; ==and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."== Amen.   
> **Matthew 28:18-20**

The writer of Hebrews also quotes this promise, and applies it to the Christian. 

> Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, =="I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU." So we may boldly say: "THE LORD IS MY HELPER; I WILL NOT FEAR. WHAT CAN MAN DO TO ME?"==
> **Hebrews 13:5-6**

Oh to meditate more upon that precious promise - God with us, Emmanuel. My friend, if you are a Christian - if you have given your life to Jesus - then that means that God Himself has made his dwelling within you by the Holy Spirit. There are times when we feel his sweet influences upon us more than other times, but that does not mean that God has left or that he comes and goes.  The promise holds true - He is abides **with** you!

## Applications

> [!bible] Deuteronomy 31:6
> Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you."   

**Question**: How can we be strong and of good courage practically

* Don't back down from the truth in our culture
	* Jesus is Lord
	* We need a savior
	* There are only 2 genders
	* etc.
* Go after God's territory
    * Indwelling sin. Your life has been claimed by God - it is his territory. 
    * Go after the expansion of God's kingdom by sharing the gospel, evangelism, foreign work
    * Your family. The Enemy wants to tear your marriage and family apart. Family worship is hard. Investing in the kids is draining. 
* Prayer

> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints—    
> **Ephesians 6:18**

**Question**: What does it mean to be strong in the Lord's strength (Eph 6), and not our own (practically)?

We tend to make this more complicated then it needs to be. 

We work hard. We exert all that we are, we obey the command to be strong and courageous, we exercise ourselves towards godliness (1 Tim 4:7). We put on the whole armor of God that we might stand in the evil day, and having done all to stand (Eph 6), we mortify sin with vigor.

And we do all this with a firm confidence in two things:

1. We can't do it ourselves - not even close. We can no more accomplish what God has called to in our own strength as the Israelites were able to conquer the Promised Land by themselves. 
2. God has promised to go before us, to be with us, and to supply us the victory. 

> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.   
> **1 Corinthians 15:10**

**Question**: How can we grow in fearlessness (practically)?

* Learn to recognize sinful fears.  Identify them, write them down, face them head on. 
* Meditate on the truth of Gods Word. 
* Get a hold on one or more promises of God - like, "He will never leave you nor forsake you". Find specific truths and promises to counteract the fears. 
* Make decisions based on faith, not fear
