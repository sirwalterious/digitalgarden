## Thesis

**Baptism is an outward sign of the internal and invisible reality of new life in Christ.** It was commanded by Jesus, practiced by the early church, and has been the sign of repentance and faith in Christ for two thousand years.

## Biblical Context of Baptism

* Initiated by John
* Submitted to by Jesus
* Continued by Jesus
* Commanded by Jesus
* Continued by the followers of Jesus
### Initiated by John

At the time of John, Baptism was part of the conversion process from Gentile to Jew, from Unclean to Clean. [1]

> [!bible] Mark 1:4-5
> John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.  

**Baptism:** *(baptizo)* To immerse, submerge; to make fully wet, to wash.

**Remission:** Removal, pardon, forgiveness of debt, freedom.

Imagine the incredible reality of Jews saying, "I need to be baptized". God was doing an amazing work of conviction! Only those who have been broken over their sin are ready to receive the gospel. Thus it makes sense that this was John's ministry of "Preparing the way of the Lord".

### Submitted to by Jesus

> [!bible] Matthew 3:13-17
> Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. And John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?" But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed Him. When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."    

Jesus did not **need** baptism for the remission of sins, because he was sinless. That's why John initially objected. And yet, Jesus **submitted** to baptism, emphasizing its importance and its "fittingness" to fulfill all righteousness. Jesus identified himself with mankind - experiencing what we experience, tempted as we are tempted - and through his baptism he set the example for all who would follow after him. 

### Continued by Jesus

> [!bible] John 3:22-23
> After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized. Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.  

 > [!bible] John 4:1-3
> Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), He left Judea and departed again to Galilee.  

### Commanded by Jesus

> [!bible] Matthew 28:18-20
> And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, "teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.
> 

### Continued by the Followers of Jesus 

Highlights from the book of Acts. 

#### First Jerusalem Believers

> [!bible] Acts 2:37-38, 41
> Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. ... Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them.  

* Observation: Baptism follows on the heels of repentance
* Observation: Baptism seems to be associated with membership in the church
#### Ethiopian Eunuch

> [!bible] Acts 8:36-38
> Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, "See, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?" Then Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." And he answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him.  

* Observation: Baptism follows on the heels of faith. As long as faith was present, there was hindrance. 
#### Saul of Tarsus

> [!bible] Acts 9:17-18
> And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized.  

* Observation: Saul (Paul) wasted no time in being baptized. 
#### Household of Cornelius

> [!bible] Acts 10:45-48
> And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered, "Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. 

* Observation: God sends his Holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household in a very visible way. Peter discerns that God is saving even the Gentiles, and thus water baptism should not be withheld. Key phrase - "just as we have". 
### Observations from Biblical Data

- Continuity of the practice of baptism - John, Jesus, the Apostles, etc.
	- Note that John's baptism is different from the baptism that Jesus commanded his followers to do.  See Acts 19. (Group of disciples in Ephesus). 
- Baptism is for the remission of sins
- Baptism accompanies repentance and confession
- Baptism accompanies faith
- Baptism is usually a public event
- Jesus considers baptism to be very important. Baptism was part of his ministry, **he** was baptized, and he commands baptism in the "great commission".
- The apostles and early Christians considered baptism to be normal and expected upon conversion
- Baptism is often associated with membership in the visible church. 
## The Theology of Baptism

> **Baptism is an outward sign of the internal and invisible reality of new life in Christ.** It was commanded by Jesus, practiced by the early church, and has been the sign of repentance and faith in Christ for two thousand years.

### The Sign of Washing

> [!bible] Acts 22:16 
> 'And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'

When we come to Christ in faith and repentance, God washes us clean from the inside out. Even our conscience is cleansed from dead works so that we may serve the living God. 

> [!bible] Hebrews 9:13-14 
> For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, **cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?**

> [!bible] 1 Peter 3:21-22 ESV
> Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body **but as an appeal to God for a good conscience,** through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.  

### The Sign of Union With Christ

Not only is baptism a sign of being washed, the greater sign is one of union with Christ - which is the very heart of the Gospel. 

> [!bible] Romans 6:3-4
> Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  

> [!bible] Colossians 2:12
> buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.  

When we are baptized into Christ, we are **identified** with Him. This gets at the heart of the Gospel. Our spiritual position is **in Him**, and we therefore share in His death and resurrection life. When we are baptized into Christ, our old man is "crucified with Him", that we may no longer be slaves of sin. And then we also raised up with Him into newness of life.

Put another way, when you go into the waters of baptism, you are identifying with Christ in His death and burial. You are proclaiming to all that you are dying to your old self, dying to your old man, and joining Christ in his death. And when you rise from the waters of baptism, you are proclaiming that you are risen with Christ as a new, born-again, creation of God. You identity has fundamentally changed - you are in Christ, and part of His church. 

> [!bible] Galatians 3:26-28
> For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.  

## Practicals and Application at WCF

* Sacrament vs Ordinance. We use the terms interchangeably at WCF. For the sake of clarity, when we say "sacrament", we do not mean that the act of dunking into water saves you apart from faith and repentance.
- Upon repentance and confession of faith, you should pursue baptism. Indeed, you are commanded to. This is the pattern of the New Testament.
* At WCF, we practice "Credobaptism", or "Believer's baptism". This means that we don't baptize infants, we only baptize those who are old enough to believe. There are many good brothers and sisters who are "Paedobaptists" - that means that they do baptize infants of Christian families. Both perspectives (Credo and Paedo) draw support from Biblical arguments. 
- Baptism ought to be a public matter of identification with Christ and his church. This should be done in the presence of God's people, and with much rejoicing. 
- You must be baptized in order to be a Familyship member at WCF. This is how Christians have always been identified (both Biblically and historically).
- You must be baptized in order to partake in the Lord's Supper (Communion).
	- Baptism is initiatory - we do it once upon entrance into covenant with Christ. 
	- The Lord's Supper is a regular.  It is the ongoing remembrance and celebration of the covenant. 

> Baptism is an outward sign of the internal and invisible reality of new life in Christ. It was commanded by Jesus, practiced by the early church, and has been the sign of repentance and faith in Christ for two thousand years.

* Delight in Gospel!
	* Are you delighting in being washed?
	* Are you delighting in union with Christ?
* If you consider yourself a Christian, but are not baptized, talk to the elders!  Let's get you baptized. 
* Reminder: The New Testament knows nothing of people coming to Christ without being baptized. Let's keep that in mind in our evangelism. 
* Parents: As we disciple our children, baptism should be a part of the gospel conversations that we have. When they are ready to make an un-pressured public confession of Christ, then they are ready to be baptized.
