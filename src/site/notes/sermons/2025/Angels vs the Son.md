> [!bible] Hebrews 1:6-12
> (6) But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: "Let all the angels of God worship Him." (7) And of the angels He says: "Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire." (8) But to the Son [He says]: "Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your kingdom. (9) You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions." (10) And: "You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. (11) They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment; (12) Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail."

## Review

> **Hebrews 1:1-5**
> (1) God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, (2) ==has in these last days spoken to us by [His] Son,== whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; (3) who being the brightness of [His] glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, (4) having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. (5) For to which of the angels did He ever say: "You are My Son, Today I have begotten You"? And again: "I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a Son"?

* The author is writing to Jewish believers
* The recipients understand and reverence the scriptures
* The author of Hebrews starts off this letter (or sermon) by establishing the superiority of the Son - the ultimate revelation.

## 0. An Introduction to Angels

Not much is revealed about angels in the Bible - And that is very purposeful. The point of revelation (the Bible) is to reveal God and his redemption, not to speculate about angels. That said, angels are baked into the story, they are part of the ensemble of the cast -  always playing a supportive and not primary role. Here's what we know:

* There are many of them
	* Luke 2:13 - "Multitude of the heavenly host"
* There are different categories of angelic beings, different roles, different appearances
	* Cherubim
		* Guard the tree of life, at the throne of God (God "dwells between the cherubim") 4 wings, 4 heads
		* Ezekiel, Exodus.
	* Seraphim
		* 6 wings, not as much info about them
		* Isaiah 6 - A seraph brought a hot coal from the fire to Isaiah
	* Other angelic hosts and spirits.
* Some have names
	* Michael, Gabriel, Lucifer
* Some form a "counsel" of sorts
	* 1 Kings 22:19-22 - God said "Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he might fall (be killed)?"
	* Job - Satan before God
* They are spirits - they don't have bodies like we do - and they don't have family relations like we do.
	* Matt 22:30 - â€œFor in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God[fn] in heaven."
* Some angels can disguise themselves as humans
	* Abraham, Lot. 
	* Heb 13:2 - Some have entertained angels "unaware". 
* Angels often demonstrate supernatural power, and wield impressive authority and glory
	* Lot: striking people with blindness
	* Zachariah/Gabriel: Striking him mute
	* People are always afraid and fall down to worship. (Rev 22:8)
	* Though they are limited and harnessed by God, these are powerful beings.  These are beings who can "rule worlds". Lucifer thought that he could rule the universe. 
* Angels are NOT made in the image of God
* Angels can choose (or at least some have chosen) to rebel against God. We call them demons.

There's a lot to more that we could meditate on when it comes to angels... But the point of this passage is not angels, but the **Son.** And this is the glorious reality - as amazing as angels are, as powerful as they are, as glorious as they are, they pale in comparison to the Son. To pursue knowledge of angels is to pursue but a shadow of God's glory; the Son is the bright sunshine of God's glory. To pursue knowledge of angels is like pursuing knowledge of the butlers, bakers, and barbers of a king... when you have the opportunity to have an intimate and personal relationship with the King himself! 

**Angels vs The Son.  Let's see how they stack up!**

## One more side note....

* We interpret the Scripture with Scripture - this is hermeneutics 101.
* We're going to have the opportunity to understand some Old Testament passages in light of New Testament revelation - and it's going to be glorious. 

## 1. Angels Worship The Son


> [!bible] Hebrews 1:6 
> But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: "Let all the angels of God worship Him."

### Cross Reference

The cross reference here is a little tricky. This could be referring to 2 different places.  The first is Deuteronomy 32:43. This is the very end of the Song of Moses. In the ESV it says:

> **Deuteronomy 32:43 ESV**  
> "Rejoice with him, O heavens; bow down to him, all gods, for he avenges the blood of his children and takes vengeance on his adversaries. He repays those who hate him and cleanses his people's land."

The Masoretic Hebrew text - which is what the KJV and NJKV are based on - does not include the line "bow down to him, all gods".  The ESV pulls that line in from other textual sources, like the dead sea scrolls and the Septuigent. 

The second possible cross reference is Psalm 97:7.

> **Psalm 97:7** 
> Let all be put to shame who serve carved images, Who boast of idols. Worship Him, all [you] gods.

Don't be dismayed by the rendering "gods" - that is simply the Hebrew word "Elohim" - the plural of "El", or God. Elohim is a generic term for God, gods, angels, heavenly host. In this case it seems to refer to the principalities and powers, the angelic and spiritual rulers. 

### 1.1 Only God Is Worthy of Worship
	
**Worship:** To adore, to give supreme respect and reverence, to fear, to serve.  Literally in the Hebrew, to prostrate or bow down.

The Scriptures are clear that only God is worthy of worship. Jesus himself makes that argument, quoting Deut 6:13. 

> **Matthew 4:8-10**
> (8) Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. (9) And he said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me." (10) Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, =='You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.' "==

The angels also know this principle. 

> **Revelation 22:8-9**
> (8) Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. (9) Then he said to me, "==See [that you do] not [do that].== For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. ==Worship God.=="

### 1.2 The Worship of God is Connected to the Son

**This is breathtaking.** The author of Hebrews takes an Old Testament reference to God (specifically "Yahweh"), and attributes it to Jesus - the Son.  This means that Jesus is God, Jesus and Yahweh are One, and that Jesus is worthy of the same adoration and worship as the Father. 

> **Psalm 97:1-12**
> (1) The LORD reigns; Let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad! (2) Clouds and darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice [are] the foundation of His throne. (3) A fire goes before Him, And burns up His enemies round about. (4) His lightnings light the world; The earth sees and trembles. (5) The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. (6) The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples see His glory. (7) Let all be put to shame who serve carved images, Who boast of idols. ==Worship **Him,** all [you] gods.== (8) Zion hears and is glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments, O LORD. (9) For You, LORD, [are] most high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods. (10) You who love the LORD, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. (11) Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart. (12) Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.

## 2.  Angels Are Servants

> [!bible] Hebrews 1:7
> And of the angels He says: "Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire."

### Cross Reference

> **Psalm 104:1-4**
> (1) Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, You are very great: You are clothed with honor and majesty, (2) Who cover [Yourself] with light as [with] a garment, Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain. (3) He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters, Who makes the clouds His chariot, Who walks on the wings of the wind, ==(4) Who makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire.==

* Sometimes "angels" is translated as "messengers"
* Sometimes "spirits" is translated as "winds"

### The Purpose of Angels

The point that the author of Hebrews is making is that angels are servants and errand boys. They are mighty, powerful beings, fully under the command of God, **and their entire purpose is to serve God, His people, and His redemptive purposes**.

* Messengers (example - Gabriel)
* Protectors and warriors (example - Elisha surrounded by firey chariots)
* Servants (examples - doing things for God, like in Revelation)

> **Hebrews 1:14**
> Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation?

## 3. The Son is the Divine King (Angels are Not)

> [!bible] Hebrews 1:8-9
> (8) But to the Son [He says]: "Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your kingdom. (9) You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions."

### Cross Reference

This is a well-known Messianic love song. It clearly sets forth:

* A prophetic vision of God's King (The Messiah/Christ).
* This King is separate from God, and yet is God
* This King is to be worshiped

> **Psalm 45:1-11**
> (1) To the Chief Musician. Set to "The Lilies." A Contemplation of the sons of Korah. A Song of Love. My heart is overflowing with a good theme; I recite my composition ==concerning the King;== My tongue [is] the pen of a ready writer. (2) You are fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Your lips; ==Therefore God has blessed You forever.== (3) Gird Your sword upon [Your] thigh, O Mighty One, With Your glory and Your majesty. (4) And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, [and] righteousness; And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things. (5) Your arrows [are] sharp in the heart of the King's enemies; The peoples fall under You. (6) ==Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your kingdom. (7) You love righteousness and hate wickedness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.== (8) All Your garments [are scented] with myrrh and aloes [and] cassia, Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad. (9) Kings' daughters [are] among Your honorable women; At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir. (10) Listen, O daughter, Consider and incline your ear; Forget your own people also, and your father's house; (11) So the King will greatly desire your beauty; ==Because He [is] your Lord, worship Him.==


> [!help]
> Break down the subjects of this passage. Son = God, Son is the King.

### What this means 

This is far more than angels can hope to attain. Jesus is the king, and not only is he the king, but he is the **divine** king, the God-king. He is worthy of worship. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. 

Angels - as cool as they are - cannot even begin to compare with this kind of power and authority and divine identity. 

## 4. The Son is the Eternal Creator (Angels are Not)

> [!bible] Hebrews 1:10-12
> (10) And: "You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. (11) They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment; (12) Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail."

### Cross Reference

> **Psalm 102:24-28** 
> (24) I said, "O my God, Do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years [are] throughout all generations. (25) Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens [are] the work of Your hands. (26) They will perish, but You will endure; Yes, they will all grow old like a garment; Like a cloak You will change them, And they will be changed. (27) But You [are] the same, And Your years will have no end. (28) The children of Your servants will continue, And their descendants will be established before You."

### Jesus is Creator

_"You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands"._

 In Psalm 45 we saw the Son connected to God in his Kingship.  Here we see the Son connected to God as **Creator.**

> **Colossians 1:15-17**
> (15) He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. ==(16) For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.== All things were created through Him and for Him. (17) And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.

> **John 1:1-3** 
> (1) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (2) He was in the beginning with God. (3) ==All things were made through Him,== and without Him nothing was made that was made.

### Jesus is Eternal

_"But You [are] the same, And Your years will have no end."_

The Son had no beginning and he will have no end. Just as God is eternal, so the Son is eternal. As Alex said last week, He is "eternally begotten".  

## Conclusion

> [!bible] Hebrews 1:6-12
> (6) But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: "Let all the angels of God worship Him." (7) And of the angels He says: "Who makes His angels spirits And His ministers a flame of fire." (8) But to the Son [He says]: "Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your kingdom. (9) You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions." (10) And: "You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. (11) They will perish, but You remain; And they will all grow old like a garment; (12) Like a cloak You will fold them up, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will not fail."

1. Angels Worship the Son
2. Angels are Servants
3. The Son is the Divine King (Angels are Not)
4. The Son is the Eternal Creator (Angels are Not)

**Angels vs the Son - The match-up was over before it even began.**
### Simplicity and Purity of Devotion to Christ

What should our response to all this truth be?  We have seen a glimpse of the majesty of the Son. 

Certainly we should glory and rejoice in these realities.  Our Savior is King!  Our Savior is God!  Our Christ is Creator and will rule and reign forever and ever. These are reasons to rejoice. 

Certainly our response should include worship. Psalm 45:11b says "Because He is your Lord, worship Him". These passages demonstrate clearly that Jesus is God, and therefore we should worship Him as such. I desire to for us to grow in worship, not just in singing, but in private prayer, corporate prayer, and in how we live every aspect of our lives. He is worthy of every breath that we breathe. 

But most of all, this is the response that I desire for myself and for us as a church: **Simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ.**

> **2 Corinthians 11:3**
> But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity [of devotion] to Christ.

#### False Gospels

There are so many ways that the Enemy tries to distract us from Christ. One of the most destructive ways in history has been to bring a false gospel through some kind of angelic communication. In the year 610 AD, a man had the first of many encounters with an angel who called himself Gabriel. New revelation was given - revelation that de-emphasized Jesus Christ - and as a result a new religion was born - Islam. Islam now holds **one quarter** of the world under its bondage. 

Another example, this one more close to home. In the early 1820s, a young man named Joseph Smith supposedly experienced visions of God, and an angel named "Moroni" started visiting him and giving him new revelation - revelation that was outside of the Bible and contradicted core Christian doctrine like the trinity and the atonement of Christ. A new religion was born - Mormonism - and it currently deceives around 17 million people, most of whom are in the Americas. 

> My faith is, when we have done all we can, then the Lord is under obligation, and will not disappoint the faithful; he will perform the rest.
> **Brigham Young**

What do these examples have in common?

* Extra angelic revelation
* Diminishment of Christ - His person, his work, and his revelation
* Diminishment of the Old and New Testament scriptures

All these things should be danger and warning signs!!!  Do not stray from Christ. Do not be swayed with strange winds of doctrine. 

> **Hebrews 13:8-9a**
> (8) Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday, today, and forever. (9) Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. 

>**Galatians 1:6-8** 
> (6) I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, (7) which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. (8) But even if we, ==or an angel from heaven,== preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.

#### Worldliness

But, you may say, I'm not tempted to pursue angels or go after false religions.  Yet still you may be distracted from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ. there are all manner of sins and worldliness that dulls our spiritual senses. Little by little they creep in, and we see the glory and goodness of Christ less and less. He has not changed, but our senses have become dull and we can no longer see Him as we ought. Our desire for prayer and communion with Him wanes.  We no longer praise from the heart because we do not see a reason for praise; sin has blinded the heart. 

May God use this message to spur you to repentance!  And when you confess your worldliness and sin, God can remove the blinders in an instant.  Like the scales fell off Paul's eyes, God can remove the scales from your eyes and give you sight again. 

#### Non-wicked and good things

Then there are non-wicked things that can take a out-sized position in our soul. Or even good things that can get in the way of Christ. We can become obsessed with business, relationships, social media, theology, coffee, sports, pets, kids, our spouse, food, house, hobbies, health, history, books, movies, exercise, politics, culture, etc.  Many of these things are good, and we should pursue them with excellence. But may we not pursue them to the detrimate of simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ. 

There is no getting beyond Christ in Christianity. There is no "moving on" past the person and work of Christ in the life of the Christian.  Have you "moved on"? O brother, O sister... Let's re-align our lives to be focused on Jesus. 

In these last days, God has spoken to us by his Son - and that changes everything.
