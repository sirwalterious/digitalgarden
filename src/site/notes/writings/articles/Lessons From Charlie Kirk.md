In my life there are a handful of world/political events that I regard as "I lived through history" moments. The first was the George W. Bush election of 2000 (remember hanging chads, anyone?), then 9/11, and the war with Iraq. I remember when so-called gay marriage first became a thing in New Paltz, NY - just a 40-minute drive from my hometown. More recently, we had the Covid-19 shutdowns, the overturning of Roe v Wade, and a wild 2024 presidential election. 

The assassination - or martyrdom - of Charlie Kirk sits in my personal reckoning as one of those moments. 

Much has been said about Charlie, and much will continue to be said. God used him to have an incredible impact on Christian and conservative thought in the last handful of years, and his influence will be felt for a generation. 

But I will let better tongues and pens than my own eulogize. My aim is simply to draw from Charlie's example a few lessons and principles that we can take to heart and learn from. 

### 1. Culture and politics is rooted in morality, and morality is rooted in God. 

I believe that one of the biggest mistakes of Conservatism over the past several decades is that we believed the lie that we could construct a moral society without submission to ultimate authority - the God of morality. If culture and politics is a car, and morality and virtue is the engine, then God (and specifically, Christianity and the gospel) is the fuel. A moral society cannot run without it. 

Conservatives have tried to promote a society that runs on the fumes of Christianity - mere good values - and not the substance. A moral society must be firmly rooted in the God of the Bible, just as the engine must have a direct connection to the gasoline. No amount of "traditional values" or "good opinions" will do. 

Charlie understood this. His political activism was grounded in the authority of Scripture and the transforming power of the Gospel. His arguments were explicitly theological, and I think that's one of the reasons why his work was so successful.

### 2. Theology matters. 

Everyone is a theologian. The only question is, are you a good one or a bad one?

Charlie demonstrated with quick wit and cutting logic that theology matters. His arguments weren't rocket science. They were simply the result of putting Christianity 101 into practice. Doctrines such as the depravity of man, Imago Deo, Lordship of Christ, justice of God, priesthood of believers, and more - all of these have very practical implications in political policy and day-to-day life. 

In this postmodern age, we should seek to know foundational doctrines inside and out, be unmoving in the authority and sufficiency of Scripture, and be able to articulate the "why" behind what we believe. 

### 3. Boldness in Gospel proclamation is not optional.

I am reminded of the following Bible verses:

> **2 Timothy 4:2**
> Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.

> **1 Peter 3:15**
> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;

One of the best forms of discipleship is learning by example. And in Charlie Kirk, we've all been given an example of what bold Gospel proclamation can look like in our people-pleasing, cancel-culture age. Courage is contagious. 

Not many of us will have the platform that Charlie had, but all of us can be bold in testifying of Christ and His truth. A conversation with a neighbor; Thanksgiving dinner with extended family; Carpool time with a co-worker; Public testimony time at the school board.  

We have a microphone, and it's turned on. Will we speak?
### 4. People are more open to Christianity than we think.

If you're like me, you feel the cultural zeitgeist, or spirit of the age, very acutely. Our culture has a code of ethics - and proclaiming objective truth is one of its cardinal sins. I expect to feel awkward, I expect to be ostracized, I expect to be hated for sharing my beliefs. 

But the reality is that people are hungry for truth - more hungry than I realize. Young people especially are looking for truth that never changes, rock beneath their feet, and are open to spiritual topics. Charlie tapped into this in a big way. 

Jesus said that the harvest was plentiful. Do we believe that? Do we believe that there are still many souls to be saved? Do we believe that there are dead souls around us who need someone to proclaim Christ to them?

If we believe that, then let's gird up our loins and get to work. Labor heartily and with joy in whatever corner of the field that the Lord has given you. The Lord of the harvest is worthy!
