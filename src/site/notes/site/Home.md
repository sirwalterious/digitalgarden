# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Walter. 

I'm a [leader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waltermwillis/) in the software, web, and digital space, working for a global manufacturing company. I'm a Christian bi-vocational pastor and worship leader, happily serving along with a plurality of pastors in [my local church](https://www.windsorchristian.com/). 

Most importantly, I'm a husband of 10 years and father to 4 incredible little blessings (with another one on the way).
